# MeetEase AI  
## Your online meeting partner
`This application was developed by Kanyarasi (group of delusional school friends) for a hackathon hosted by Flipr. (Won 2nd place btw haha)`

### What is MeetEase AI?
Meet Ease AI is an application which listens (and records) to the conversation that is going on in the meeting without actually joining the meet. Yep it may cause privacy issues but you agree to it when using our application and relax, we are not going to share your boring conversation to anyone (we don't know how to store the recording hehe). 

It then transcribes the recording using our advanced AI text-to-speech software (its an API call) into human read-able summary and action items based on urgency or importance (medium efficiency).

The application also allows you to mail the summary or action items to your inbox.

### Language used:
Typescript (TS)
